    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>As the recipient of the Pepsi Challenge Mini-Grant to Expand the Sustainable Communities Collaborative at Penn State, the “Sustainovation Team” has partnered with Ridley Creek State Park in an effort to promote environmental education and interpretation.</p>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Presently, the Ridley Creek State Park (RCSP) contains approximately 12 miles of trails with over 48 numbered trees that refer to a Tree Identification Quiz. Unfortunately, many of the tree markers are no longer intact, and the answer key for this quiz is located only in the park office. This means that visitors have a difficult time gaining the education that Ridley Creek State Park is trying to promote. In an effort to promote environmental awareness and sustainable tourism, we propose to develop a web application for the park visitors to reference information about all of the numbered trees. Information and images for each of the marked trees will be stored, and available to visitors. Our application will display the available information and images for each tree, starting with the closest tree to the park visitor, using GPS coordinates and positioning. We believe that this initiative will promote the education about trees that RCSP has been aiming to share with the public.</p>
